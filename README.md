# How to use -v option for docker run

As we all know if we want to proxy or map a local port from our local system to a container
we use `-p` option like

```
docker run -p <LocalPORT>:<ContainerPORT>
```

Example

```
docker run -p 3001:3000 rohityadav007/client
```

Similarly we can use `-v` option for referencing local volume to container volume

**Syntax**

```
docker run -v <LocalVolume>:<ContainerVolume>
```

Example

```
docker run -p 3001:3000 -v $PWD:/app rohityadav007/client
```

In case you want to exclude any of the dir or file to be mapped then we can just pass container volume path

Example

```
docker run -p 3001:3000 -v /app/node_modules/ -v $(pwd):/app rohityadav007/client
```

in this case `-v /app/node_modules/` will exclude from the mapping

## override startup command from the docker-compose

We can make use of `command` option
